            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Crop Recommendation System is designed to assist farmers in selecting the best crop to plant based on the soil and weather conditions of their specific location. This system leverages machine learning algorithms to provide accurate recommendations that can enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. By using this system, farmers can make informed decisions that lead to better yields and more efficient use of resources.

            <h2>How We Built This Project</h2>
            <p>
                The development of this project involved several key steps, each contributing to the accuracy and effectiveness of the final recommendation system.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Collection:</strong>
                    <p>We collected data on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall from various sources, including government databases and agricultural research institutions. This comprehensive dataset was essential for training our crop recommendation model.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
                    <p>Data preprocessing involved cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure its suitability for machine learning. This step included handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Model Training:</strong>
                    <p>We used a Random Forest Classifier to train our crop recommendation model. The model was trained on the processed data, and its performance was evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Geolocation Integration:</strong>
                    <p>We integrated geolocation services using the ArcGIS API to convert user-provided addresses into geographic coordinates. This feature allows the system to accurately map the user's location to the corresponding district for soil and weather data retrieval.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weather Data Retrieval:</strong>
                    <p>We used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for the user's location. This data includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions, which are crucial for accurate crop recommendations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):</strong>
                    <p>The KNN algorithm was implemented to find the nearest district based on the user's geographic coordinates. This ensures that the most relevant soil data is used for crop prediction.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Web Application Development:</strong>
                    <p>We developed a web application using Flask to provide an easy-to-use interface for farmers. The application allows users to input their address, fetches the necessary data, and displays the crop recommendations along with detailed soil and weather information.</p>
